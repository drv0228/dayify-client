## Overview

This app is an E-commerce to buy essentials products for families in Latin America.

### Problem

My brother-in-law runs a business that exports products from the USA to various countries in Latin America. The purpose of this endeavor is to assist families in the USA by enabling them to send gifts, food, and essential products to their relatives in times of need or simply to express love through thoughtful gifts on their birthdays. This initiative not only fosters cross-border connections but also contributes to the well-being and joy of families on both ends of the exchange.

### User Profile

The app will be designed for individuals in the USA who wish to send gifts, food, and essential products to their families in Latin America through the export business that my brother in law runs. Users should be able to browse through a catalog of available products, select items they want to send, and add them to their virtual cart.
